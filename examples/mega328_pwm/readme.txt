mega328_PWM:
This example illustrates how to capture a PWM signal generated by a Timer/Counter.
The firmware outputs 2 PWM signals on OC1A and OC1B. OC1A ratio is fixed whereas OC1B ratio
is variable.
The output is captured in a VCD file and the final state dumped in a text file, for verification.

To compile the firmware, ensure AVR-GCC is in PATH and execute :
avr-gcc -Os -g -mmcu=atmega328 -o mega328_PWM_fw.elf mega328_PWM_fw.c
